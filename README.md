## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Login using SAWO sdk (the passwordless way)
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

Keeping in mind the goal to be achieved, I created a mobile app which could tackle all the given points.
The flutter app uses [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) which is a Dart implementation of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for Flutter apps.
